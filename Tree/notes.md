*** Inorder traversal is not a unique identifier of BST. At the same time both preorder and postorder traversals are unique identifiers of BST.***
*** From these traversals one could restore the inorder one: inorder = sorted(postorder) = sorted(preorder)***
*** and inorder + postorder or inorder + preorder are both unique identifiers of whatever binary tree. ***
