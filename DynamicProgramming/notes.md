* Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint.
* You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems.
* Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
* The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
* Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems.
* There’s no single formula for calculating a dynamic-programming solution.
